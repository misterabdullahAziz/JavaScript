# JavaScript Data Structures!

## “Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.” — Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux

Data structures are a critical part of software development, and one of the most common topics for developer job interview questions.

JavaScript (like most high-level languages) has built-in implementations of many of these data structures.

Still, knowing how to implement these data structures will give you a huge edge in your developer job search, and may come in handy when you’re trying to write high-performance code.

I am gonna implement following data structures in javascript es5 and es6.

 1. Stack
 2. Queses
 3. Linked Lists
 4. Sets
 5. Maps
 6. Hash Tables
 7. Binary Search Tree
 8. Trie
 9. Binary Heap
 10. Graph 

The book _Grokking Algorithms_ is the best book on the topic if you are new to data structures/algorithms and don’t have a computer science background.
